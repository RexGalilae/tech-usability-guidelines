# UI Standards and Guidelines

This directory contains the working documentation for building UI standards aimed at making digital interfaces more accessible and usable for older adults and people new to technology. The documents here are living resources that will evolve as we collect feedback and research.

- `principles.md` outlines the core principles guiding our work.
- `guidelines/` is where detailed, actionable guidelines derived from these principles will live.
- `resources.md` collects research papers and references that inform our approach.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests with improvements, questions, or new resources.
